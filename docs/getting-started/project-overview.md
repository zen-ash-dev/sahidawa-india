# SahiDawa — Unified Architecture & Project Context

> **Single source of truth.** Read this first before making ANY code change.  
> Last updated: May 2026 | Codebase version: MVP Phase 1 (post-PR #511 Integration)

---

## 1. Vision & Core Value Proposition

**SahiDawa** ("Sahi Dawa" = _Correct Medicine_ in Hindi) is **India's first open-source citizen medicine verification platform**. It is designed to solve three critical, intersecting healthcare challenges in India simultaneously:

1. **Fake & Counterfeit Medicines** — Studies estimate that 12% to 25% of medicines distributed in India are counterfeit. Currently, no public, citizen-facing verification system exists for checking drug authenticity.
2. **Rural Healthcare Gaps** — Over 65% of India's population resides in rural areas, where professional doctors and diagnostic resources are severely limited or entirely absent.
3. **Language Barriers** — India has 22 official regional languages, yet almost all healthcare applications and packaging information are available exclusively in English.

**Core Target User:** A rural Indian citizen, local health volunteer (ASHA worker), or NGO coordinator who wants to verify a medicine strip's authenticity before ingestion, seek basic symptom triage advice, and locate certified pharmacies or health agents nearby.

**Key Operating Principles:**

- **Free Forever:** No advertising, no monetization of patient data, and no paid API paywalls in the critical path.
- **Works on 2G / Offline-First:** Highly optimized, lightweight pages and on-device processing to ensure usability under low-bandwidth networks.
- **Community & Open Source:** Powered by crowd-sourced counterfeit reports, open-source components, and government data integration.

## 2. Core User Flows

The application orchestrates three major user journeys designed to be resilient, highly localized, and accessible:

```
Flow 1 — Scan, OCR & Verify (Offline-Capable)
  User scans barcode/QR or uploads medicine image
  → On-device ZXing scanner parses barcode or Tesseract OCR extracts text
  → The system identifies Batch Number, Expiry Date, and Brand Name
  → REST API queries Supabase 'medicines' catalog
  → Returns: REAL ✅ / SUSPICIOUS ⚠️ / FAKE ❌ + counterfeit alert flags

Flow 2 — Multilingual Voice Health Triage
  User records symptom descriptions in local language (Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, etc.)
  → ML service transcribes audio using Whisper ASR with regional language hints
  → Indian LLM (Sarvam AI) via LangChain processes user intent in native language
  → Returns: Standard triage classification, guidance, and nearest clinic recommendations

Flow 3 — Trusted Pharmacy Map
  User views location map
  → GIS query searches nearest verified Jan Aushadhi generic drugstores & ASHA workers
  → Leaflet.js maps pins dynamically on OpenStreetMap
  → Returns: Fully searchable list, directions, and direct call actions
```

## 3. Monorepo Architecture

SahiDawa is structured as a monorepo utilizing **NPM Workspaces** to ensure clear separation of concerns, high modularity, and simplified local development.

## 6. Environment Configuration

The application reads the following variables from the environment. Ensure these are defined in your local `.env` files (refer to `.env.example` at root):

| **Variable Key**            | **Target Scope** | **Security Level** | **Description / Purpose**                                              |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------- | :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SUPABASE_URL`              | Root / API       | Public             | The endpoint URL of your managed Supabase instance.                    |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`         | Root / Web / API | Public             | The public anonymous key. Safe for browser exposure.                   |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Root / API       | **Server-Only**    | Admin bypass key. **Never expose to client or frontend code!**         |
| `PORT`                      | API              | Configurable       | Local port designation for Express gateway (Defaults to `4000`).       |
| `ML_PORT`                   | ML               | Configurable       | Local port designation for Python FastAPI (Defaults to `8000`).        |
| `REDIS_URL`                 | API              | **Server-Only**    | Redis connection URI for caching medicine catalog records.             |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL`            | Web / API        | **Server-Only**    | Media uploads target for storing uploaded counterfeit medicine images. |
| `SARVAM_API_KEY`            | ML               | **Server-Only**    | Indian LLM engine API token for localized voice triaging.              |

## 7. Workspace Development Commands

To ensure packages are resolved correctly and dependencies remain centralized, **always run NPM commands from the repository root**. Never `cd` into sub-folders to run `npm install`.

```bash
# 1. Install all dependencies across all monorepo workspaces
npm install

# 2. Run the Next.js frontend in development mode
npm run dev -w web            # Serves local frontend on http://localhost:3000

# 3. Run the Express API gateway in development mode
npm run dev -w api            # Serves local backend on http://localhost:4000

# 4. Install a new dependency in a specific workspace
npm install <pkg_name> -w web   # Installs only inside Next.js client
npm install <pkg_name> -w api   # Installs only inside Express backend

# 5. Run standard Jest unit test suites
npm run test -w web           # Executes frontend Jest unit test files
```

---

## 8. Tailwind v4 Design Tokens

SahiDawa is designed with a premium, accessible, and high-performance dark/light interface. Colors and dimensions are standardized as theme tokens:

- **Brand Accent Palette:** Emerald Green (`emerald-500` / `#10b981`, `emerald-400`, `emerald-600`). Represents trust, medical validation, and safety.
- **Canvas Backgrounds:**
    - **Slate Light (`slate-50`):** Applied across global landing grids, navigation portals, and pharmacy maps to ensure readability under direct sunlight.
    - **Absolute Pitch Black (`black` / `slate-900`):** Applied exclusively in camera scanners (`/scan`) and audio triage screens (`/voice`) to focus visual attention, save battery life on AMOLED screens, and maximize contrast.
- **Borders & Seams:** Transparent white lines (`white/10`) on dark interfaces, and crisp light gray (`slate-200`) on light dashboards.
- **Typography:** System Sans-Serif stack styled with fluid leading dimensions.
- **Card Roundedness:** Smooth, modern shapes utilizing outer boundaries of `rounded-2xl` up to `rounded-[2.5rem]`.

> **Tailwind v4 Transition Alert:** SahiDawa uses Tailwind v4. Legacy syntax rules are deprecated:
>
> - Use `bg-linear-to-b` instead of the legacy `bg-gradient-to-b`.
> - Use `bg-size-[value]` instead of the arbitrary bracket notation `bg-[size:value]`.

## 10. Key Engineering Constraints

1. **Free & Sovereign API Paths:** Never implement paid, third-party medical API layers. All critical core steps (ASR transcription, optical text scanning, GIS mapping) must remain free and open-source (e.g. self-hosted Whisper engines, on-device OCR, OpenStreetMap).
2. **2G Network Resiliency:** Minimize overall client bundle footprint. Utilize server components where applicable, lazy-load heavy sub-packages (e.g. Web Workers for Tesseract.js), and optimize PWA caching strategies.
3. **No Hoisting Violations:** Never execute local package installs (like `cd apps/web && npm install`). Run all dependency injections from the root directory using the `-w` workspace directive to maintain clean hoist configurations.
4. **Service Keys Safety:** The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` bypasses all Row-Level Security policies. **Never commit, output, or pass this variable inside any client-side frontend code.** Keep it strictly locked in backend API server scopes.
5. **Tailwind v4 Strict Theme Compliance:** Do not introduce a `tailwind.config.js` file. Custom color rules, fonts, and animation properties must be declared as CSS custom properties under `@theme` inside `apps/web/app/globals.css`.
