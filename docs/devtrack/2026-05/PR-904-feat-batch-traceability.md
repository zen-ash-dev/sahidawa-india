# PR #904 — Feat/batch traceability

> **Merged:** 2026-05-31 | **Author:** @Subhra-Nandi | **Area:** Backend | **Impact Score:** 48 | **Closes:** #308

## What Changed

This pull request significantly enhances our medicine verification platform by introducing comprehensive batch number traceability. We have implemented new database tables for `manufacturers` and `batches`, added a `manufacturer_id` foreign key to the `medicines` table, and exposed new API endpoints under `/api/verify/batch`. These endpoints allow citizens to retrieve detailed information about a specific medicine batch, including manufacturer details, recall status, and a color-coded expiry warning, as well as report issues with a batch.

## The Problem Being Solved

Prior to this PR, our system lacked the granularity to provide detailed information at the individual medicine batch level. While we could verify medicines, there was no mechanism to:

1.  **Trace a specific batch** back to its manufacturer with full contact and location details.
2.  **Communicate recall status** for a particular batch.
3.  **Provide clear expiry warnings** based on the batch's manufacturing and expiry dates.
4.  **Allow citizens to report issues** specifically tied to a batch number, which is crucial for identifying counterfeit or substandard medicines in the supply chain.
    This limitation hindered our ability to provide a complete trust and safety layer for Indian medicine consumers, making it difficult to identify and react to potential health risks associated with specific batches.

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema Changes (`supabase/migrations/20260527000000_add_batches_manufacturers.sql`)

We introduced two new tables and modified an existing one to support batch traceability:

1.  **`manufacturers` table**:
    - Stores comprehensive details about medicine manufacturers.
    - Columns include: `id` (PK), `name`, `license_number`, `address`, `city`, `state`, `pincode`, `phone`, `email`, `website`, `gmp_certified` (boolean), and `location` (PostGIS `GEOMETRY(Point, 4326)` for geographical coordinates).
    - This table centralizes manufacturer data, allowing multiple batches and medicines to link to a single manufacturer record.

2.  **`batches` table**:
    - Dedicated to storing batch-specific information.
    - Columns include: `id` (PK), `batch_number` (unique identifier for the batch), `medicine_id` (FK to `medicines.id`), `manufacturer_id` (FK to `manufacturers.id`), `manufacturing_date`, `expiry_date`, `recall_status` (e.g., 'none', 'active', 'completed'), `recall_reason`, and `quantity_produced`.
    - This table allows us to store distinct batch data separate from general medicine information.

3.  **`medicines` table modification**:
    - A new column, `manufacturer_id` (FK to `manufacturers.id`), was added. This allows existing medicine records to link to the new `manufacturers` table, providing a path for gradual data migration and ensuring that even older medicine records can eventually point to structured manufacturer data.

### API Endpoints (`apps/api/src/routes/batch.ts`)

A new router, `batchRouter`, was created to handle batch-related API requests.

1.  **`GET /api/verify/batch/:batchNumber`**:
    - **Purpose**: Provides full traceability details for a given batch number.
    - **Input Validation**: Uses `zod` with `BATCH_NUMBER_SCHEMA` to validate the `batchNumber` path parameter. This schema enforces alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and slashes, with a length between 3 and 100 characters, preventing invalid inputs or potential injection attacks.
    - **Data Retrieval**:
        - The primary lookup is performed on the `batches` table using a single Supabase query with `select` and nested joins: `medicine:medicines(...)` and `manufacturer:manufacturers(*)`. This efficiently retrieves batch, associated medicine, and manufacturer data in one go, avoiding N+1 query issues.
        - **Fallback Mechanism**: If no record is found in the `batches` table, the system attempts to find a matching `batch_number` directly in the `medicines` table. This provides backward compatibility and ensures that medicines with batch numbers stored directly in the `medicines` table (from before the `batches` table existed) can still be looked up. If a medicine record is found with a `manufacturer_id`, it then fetches the manufacturer details from the `manufacturers` table. If `manufacturer_id` is null, it uses the `manufacturer` string from the `medicines` table.
    - **Expiry Status Calculation**: The `getExpiryStatus` helper function determines the expiry warning color:
        - `red`: If the expiry date is in the past or less than 1 month away.
        - `yellow`: If the expiry date is between 1 and 6 months away (inclusive).
        - `green`: If the expiry date is more than 6 months away.
        - `unknown`: If no expiry date is provided.
    - **Response Structure**: Returns a JSON object containing `found` status, `source` (indicating if data came from `batches` or `medicines` table), and detailed objects for `batch`, `medicine`, `manufacturer`, and `expiry_status`. Manufacturer coordinates are extracted from the PostGIS `location` field.
    - **Rate Limiting**: This endpoint is protected by `batchLimiter`.

2.  **`POST /api/verify/batch/report`**:
    - **Purpose**: Allows users to report issues related to a specific medicine batch, creating an entry in the `counterfeit_reports` table.
    - **Input Validation**: Uses `zod` with `reportBatchSchema`, which requires `batchNumber` (validated by `BATCH_NUMBER_SCHEMA`) and a `description` (min 10 characters). Optional fields include `reporterName`, `city`, `state`, `pincode`, and `pharmacyName`.
    - **Data Insertion**: Not documented in this PR. We infer it inserts the validated data into the `counterfeit_reports` table.
    - **Rate Limiting**: This endpoint is also protected by `batchLimiter`.

### Rate Limiting (`apps/api/src/middleware/rateLimit.ts`)

A new rate limiter, `batchLimiter`, was introduced:

- **Configuration**: `windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000` (1 hour window), `max: 100` (100 requests per IP per hour).
- **Key Generation**: Uses a custom `keyGenerator` to accurately identify unique users based on `x-forwarded-for` header (for proxies/load balancers) or `req.socket.remoteAddress`.
- **Error Handling**: Returns a `429 Too Many Requests` status with a specific error message.

### Application Routing (`apps/api/src/app.ts`)

The `batchRouter` was integrated into the main Express application:

- `app.use("/api/verify/batch", batchRouter);` was added.
- **Order of Registration**: It is crucial that `/api/verify/batch` is registered _before_ the more general `/api/verify` route to ensure that batch-specific requests are handled by the `batchRouter` and not incorrectly routed to the general verification logic.

### API Documentation (`apps/api/src/utils/swagger.ts`)

- New component schemas for `Batch` and `Manufacturer` were added to our OpenAPI (Swagger) specification. This ensures that the new API endpoints are well-documented and discoverable for developers consuming our API.

### Changes to `apps/web/app/api/chat/route.ts`

Not documented in this PR. The specific changes to this file are not detailed in the provided information.

## Technical Decisions

1.  **Dedicated `batches` and `manufacturers` tables**: We chose to create new, normalized tables (`batches`, `manufacturers`) rather than overloading the existing `medicines` table. This decision was driven by:
    - **Data Integrity**: Ensures that manufacturer details are stored once and referenced by multiple medicines/batches, reducing redundancy and potential inconsistencies.
    - **Scalability**: Allows for independent scaling and querying of manufacturer and batch data, which will become increasingly important as our dataset grows.
    - **Flexibility**: Provides a clear structure for future enhancements, such as manufacturer-specific portals or more complex supply chain tracking.
    - **Geospatial Data**: The `location` column in `manufacturers` uses PostGIS `GEOMETRY(Point, 4326)`, enabling efficient storage and querying of geographical coordinates for manufacturers, which is vital for location-based services or regional analysis.

2.  **Zod for Input Validation**: We continued our pattern of using `zod` for API input validation. Zod provides:
    - **Type Safety**: Ensures that incoming request bodies and parameters conform to expected types and structures.
    - **Clear Error Messages**: Generates detailed error messages that are helpful for API consumers.
    - **Schema Definition**: Allows us to define clear, reusable schemas like `BATCH_NUMBER_SCHEMA` and `reportBatchSchema`.

3.  **Supabase Client for Database Interaction**: Leveraging our existing Supabase client (`supabase` object) for all database operations ensures consistency and utilizes the built-in ORM-like capabilities for efficient data fetching and manipulation. The use of `select` with nested joins (`medicine:medicines(...)`, `manufacturer:manufacturers(*)`) is a deliberate choice to optimize query performance by fetching all related data in a single database roundtrip, mitigating N+1 query problems.

4.  **Fallback Logic for Batch Lookup**: The decision to first query the `batches` table and then fall back to the `medicines` table for `batch_number` was made to:
    - **Ensure Backward Compatibility**: Allows existing medicine records that might have a `batch_number` directly in the `medicines` table to still be discoverable.
    - **Facilitate Gradual Data Migration**: Provides a smooth transition path as we populate the new `batches` table with more granular data over time.

5.  **Specific Rate Limiting for Batch Endpoints**: A dedicated `batchLimiter` with a window of 1 hour and a maximum of 100 requests per IP was chosen. This is more generous than general verification limits, acknowledging that users might perform multiple batch lookups, but still protects against abuse and excessive resource consumption. The custom `keyGenerator` improves accuracy in identifying unique users behind proxies.

6.  **Routing Order in `app.ts`**: Placing `app.use("/api/verify/batch", batchRouter);` before `app.use("/api/verify", verifyRouter);` is a standard Express routing practice. This ensures that more specific routes are matched and handled before more general or wildcard routes, preventing routing conflicts.

## How To Re-Implement (Contributor Reference)

To re-implement this feature from scratch, a contributor would follow these steps:

1.  **Database Schema Definition**:
    - Create the `manufacturers` table with columns: `id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()`, `name TEXT NOT NULL`, `license_number TEXT UNIQUE`, `address TEXT`, `city TEXT`, `state TEXT`, `pincode TEXT`, `phone TEXT`, `email TEXT`, `website TEXT`, `gmp_certified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE`, `location GEOMETRY(Point, 4326)`. Ensure the PostGIS extension is enabled (`CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;`).
    - Create the `batches` table with columns: `id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()`, `batch_number TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE`, `medicine_id UUID REFERENCES medicines(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`, `manufacturer_id UUID REFERENCES manufacturers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`, `manufacturing_date DATE`, `expiry_date DATE`, `recall_status TEXT DEFAULT 'none'`, `recall_reason TEXT`, `quantity_produced INT`.
    - Add `manufacturer_id UUID REFERENCES manufacturers(id) ON DELETE SET NULL` to the `medicines` table.
    - Consider adding appropriate indexes for `batch_number` on both `batches` and `medicines` tables, and `manufacturer_id` on `batches` and `medicines`.

2.  **Rate Limiter Configuration (`apps/api/src/middleware/rateLimit.ts`)**:
    - Define a new `express-rate-limit` instance named `batchLimiter`.
    - Set `windowMs` to `60 * 60 * 1000` (1 hour) and `max` to `100`.
    - Implement a `keyGenerator` function to extract the client IP from `x-forwarded-for` or `req.socket.remoteAddress`.
    - Provide a custom `handler` for `429` responses.

3.  **Batch Router Creation (`apps/api/src/routes/batch.ts`)**:
    - Initialize an Express `Router`.
    - Define Zod schemas:
        - `BATCH_NUMBER_SCHEMA`: `z.string().min(3).max(100).regex(/^[A-Za-z0-9\-\/]+$/)`.
        - `batchParamSchema`: `z.object({ batchNumber: BATCH_NUMBER_SCHEMA })`.
        - `reportBatchSchema`: `z.object({ batchNumber: BATCH_NUMBER_SCHEMA, description: z.string().min(10), ...optional fields })`.
    - Implement `getExpiryStatus(expiryDate: string | null)` helper function to return "green", "yellow", "red", or "unknown" based on date differences.
    - **`GET /:batchNumber` endpoint**:
        - Apply `batchLimiter` middleware.
        - Parse `req.params.batchNumber` using `batchParamSchema.safeParse()`. Handle validation errors with `400` response.
        - Perform a Supabase query: `supabase.from("batches").select("*, medicine:medicines(...), manufacturer:manufacturers(*)").eq("batch_number", batchNumber).maybeSingle()`.
        - If `batchData` is null, implement the fallback: query `supabase.from("medicines").select("...").eq("batch_number", batchNumber).maybeSingle()`. If `medicineData.manufacturer_id` exists, fetch manufacturer from `manufacturers` table.
        - Construct the response object, mapping database fields to the desired API output structure, including `expiry_status` from `getExpiryStatus` and extracting `lat`/`lng` from `manufacturer.location.coordinates`.
        - Return `200` for found data, `404` for not found, `500` for database errors.
    - **`POST /report` endpoint**:
        - Apply `batchLimiter` middleware.
        - Parse `req.body` using `reportBatchSchema.safeParse()`. Handle validation errors.
        - Insert the validated data into the `counterfeit_reports` table using `supabase.from("counterfeit_reports").insert(...)`.
        - Return appropriate success/error responses.

4.  **Application Integration (`apps/api/src/app.ts`)**:
    - Import `batchRouter`.
    - Add `app.use("/api/verify/batch", batchRouter);` ensuring it is placed _before_ `app.use("/api/verify", verifyRouter);` to maintain correct routing precedence.

5.  **API Documentation (`apps/api/src/utils/swagger.ts`)**:
    - Add new component schemas for `Batch` and `Manufacturer` to the `swaggerSpec` object, detailing their properties and types.
    - Document the new `GET /api/verify/batch/{batchNumber}` and `POST /api/verify/batch/report` endpoints with summaries, descriptions, parameters, and response schemas.

## Impact on System Architecture

This change represents a significant evolution in SahiDawa's data model and API capabilities, moving beyond basic medicine verification to a more robust traceability system.

- **Enriched Data Model**: The introduction of `manufacturers` and `batches` tables fundamentally enriches our core data model, allowing for more granular and accurate information about medicines. This provides a foundation for more sophisticated data analysis and reporting.
- **Enhanced Trust and Security**: By providing batch-level traceability, recall status, and expiry warnings, we significantly enhance the trust and security aspects of the platform for citizens. The batch issue reporting mechanism directly contributes to our ability to identify and combat counterfeit medicines.
- **New API Surface**: The `/api/verify/batch` endpoints create a new, critical API surface. This will be a primary interface for front-end applications and potentially third-party integrations requiring batch-specific information.
- **Foundation for Supply Chain Features**: This feature lays the groundwork for future supply chain tracking capabilities, allowing us to potentially integrate with manufacturer systems or track medicine movement more comprehensively.
- **Improved Data Quality**: The structured `manufacturers` table with PostGIS location data enables better data quality and opens up possibilities for geographical analysis of medicine production and distribution.
- **Increased Backend Complexity**: While beneficial, the new tables and join logic add complexity to our database schema and API query patterns. This is managed through careful schema design and optimized Supabase queries.

## Testing & Verification

The following aspects were verified during the development and merge process:

- **Database Migration**: The `supabase/migrations/20260527000000_add_batches_manufacturers.sql` script was successfully applied, creating the new tables and modifying the `medicines` table as expected. Foreign key constraints were verified.
- **API Endpoint Functionality (`GET /api/verify/batch/:batchNumber`)**:
    - **Batch Found in `batches` table**: Verified that a batch number existing in the `batches` table returns full details, including joined `medicine` and `manufacturer` data.
    - **Batch Found in `medicines` table (Fallback)**: Verified that a batch number existing only in the `medicines` table (without a corresponding `batches` entry) correctly triggers the fallback logic and returns available medicine and manufacturer details.
    - **Batch Not Found**: Verified that requests for non-existent batch numbers return a `404` status with `found: false`.
    - **Expiry Status Logic**: Tested various `expiry_date` values to confirm `getExpiryStatus` correctly returns "green", "yellow", and "red" warnings.
    - **Manufacturer Coordinates**: Verified that PostGIS `location` data is correctly transformed into `lat`/`lng` in the API response.
- **API Endpoint Functionality (`POST /api/verify/batch/report`)**:
    - Verified that valid reports are successfully inserted into the `counterfeit_reports` table.
    - Verified that invalid report payloads (e.g., missing description, invalid batch number format) are rejected with `400` errors due to Zod validation.
- **Input Validation (Zod)**: Tested `BATCH_NUMBER_SCHEMA` with various valid and invalid batch number formats (e.g., too short, too long, invalid characters) to ensure correct `400` responses.
- **Rate Limiting**: Verified that `batchLimiter` correctly restricts requests to 100 per hour per IP and returns a `429` status when the limit is exceeded.
- **Routing Precedence**: Confirmed that requests to `/api/verify/batch/...` are handled by the new `batchRouter` and do not conflict with the existing `/api/verify` routes.
- **Proof of Work**: Screenshots provided in the PR description visually confirm successful API responses for batch lookups.
