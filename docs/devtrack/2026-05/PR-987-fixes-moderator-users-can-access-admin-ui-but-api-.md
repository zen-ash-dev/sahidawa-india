## What Changed

This pull request primarily resolves an API authorization inconsistency where moderator users were blocked from performing administrative actions despite having access to the frontend admin UI. We updated the top-level API route for `/api/v1/admin` in `apps/api/src/app.ts` to correctly authorize both "admin" and "moderator" roles. Additionally, this PR includes several frontend UI refinements to the `Navbar` component for improved mobile responsiveness and general styling consistency across `ThemeToggle` and `page.tsx`.

## The Problem Being Solved

Before this change, our system exhibited a critical authorization flaw: moderator users, who are intended to assist with administrative tasks such as reviewing reports, fetching medicines, and updating report statuses, were unable to perform these actions. While the frontend admin dashboard UI, specifically `apps/web/app/[locale]/admin/layout.tsx`, correctly allowed both "admin" and "moderator" roles to access it, the backend API was rejecting all their requests with a `403 Forbidden` error.

The root cause was identified in `apps/api/src/app.ts`, where the top-level Express route for `/api/v1/admin` was configured with the `requireRole("admin")` middleware. This middleware exclusively permitted users with the "admin" role, effectively blocking all "moderator" role users before their requests could even reach the more granular, nested admin routes defined in `apps/api/src/routes/admin.routes.ts`, which already correctly allowed both "admin" and "moderator" roles. This inconsistency led to a frustrating and dysfunctional experience for our moderator team.

## Files Modified

- `apps/api/src/app.ts`
- `apps/web/app/[locale]/components/Navbar.tsx`
- `apps/web/app/[locale]/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`
- `apps/web/app/[locale]/page.tsx`

## Implementation Details

The core fix for the moderator access issue was implemented in `apps/api/src/app.ts`. Previously, line 98 of this file contained the following route definition for the admin API endpoints:

```typescript
app.use("/api/v1/admin", requireAuth, requireRole("admin"), adminRoutes);
```

This line was modified to include the "moderator" role in the `requireRole` middleware, making the route definition:

```typescript
app.use("/api/v1/admin", requireAuth, requireRole("admin", "moderator"), adminRoutes);
```

The `app.use` function in Express.js mounts middleware functions at a specified path. In this case, any request to `/api/v1/admin` or any sub-path thereof will first pass through `requireAuth` (to ensure the user is authenticated), then through `requireRole("admin", "moderator")` (to verify the authenticated user possesses either the "admin" or "moderator" role), and finally, if authorized, the request is handed off to the `adminRoutes` router for further processing. This change ensures that the `requireRole` middleware now correctly validates against both intended roles at the entry point of the admin API. The accompanying comment on line 97 was also updated to reflect this new behavior.

In addition to the API fix, several frontend components in `apps/web` received updates:

1.  **`apps/web/app/[locale]/components/Navbar.tsx`**: This component underwent significant refactoring to improve its responsiveness and layout, particularly for mobile devices.
    - The main container `div` changed from `grid grid-cols-3` to `flex` with `gap-2 px-3 sm:gap-3 sm:px-4 md:px-6` for more flexible spacing.
    - The logo section (`Link href="/"`) now uses `min-w-0 flex-1` and `shrink-0` on the logo image to ensure proper scaling and truncation on smaller screens. The `h1` for "SahiDawa" now includes `truncate` and responsive font sizes (`text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-2xl`).
    - The main navigation links (`<nav>`) now have `ml-6 hidden flex-1` to better manage spacing and visibility.
    - The action buttons section (`<div>`) now uses `ml-auto flex shrink-0 items-center justify-end gap-1.5 sm:gap-3` for consistent alignment and spacing.
    - Crucially, a new `button` element was introduced for the sign-in action, specifically targeting mobile viewports (`sm:hidden`), allowing the sign-in icon to remain visible on small screens, while the larger text-based sign-in button is shown on `sm` and up (`sm:flex`). Both buttons use the `User` icon from `lucide-react`.

2.  **`apps/web/app/[locale]/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`**: The `button` element for the theme toggle was updated to ensure consistent sizing and centering. It now includes `flex h-9 w-9 items-center justify-center rounded-full sm:h-10 sm:w-10` to match the new sizing conventions of other interactive elements in the `Navbar`.

3.  **`apps/web/app/[locale]/page.tsx`**: This file saw a minor cleanup, removing unused `import` statements for `Bell`, `History`, `Home`, `User` from `lucide-react` and `tNav` from `useTranslations`. This improves code hygiene and reduces bundle size slightly.

## Technical Decisions

The primary technical decision for the API authorization fix was to modify the existing `requireRole` middleware invocation at the top-level `/api/v1/admin` route. We chose this approach because:

1.  **Consistency with Existing Authorization Logic**: The `requireRole` middleware was already in place and correctly used in nested admin routes (`apps/api/src/routes/admin.routes.ts`) to allow both "admin" and "moderator" roles. Extending this logic to the top-level route in `apps/api/src/app.ts` was the most direct and least disruptive way to achieve consistency across our API authorization layers.
2.  **Leveraging Existing Middleware**: Our system already utilizes `requireAuth` and `requireRole` for robust role-based access control (RBAC). Modifying the parameters passed to `requireRole` was a simple and effective change, avoiding the need to introduce new middleware or refactor the entire authentication/authorization flow. The `requireRole` middleware is designed to accept multiple role arguments, making it flexible for scenarios like this where multiple user types share access to a resource.
3.  **Alignment with Frontend**: The frontend UI (`apps/web/app/[locale]/admin/layout.tsx`) was already correctly configured to display the admin dashboard to both "admin" and "moderator" roles. The backend fix brings the API authorization into alignment with the intended user experience and roles.

For the frontend changes, the decisions were driven by:

1.  **Improved Mobile UX**: The `Navbar.tsx` modifications, particularly the introduction of a mobile-specific sign-in button, address a common usability issue where critical actions might be hidden or difficult to access on smaller screens. Using Tailwind CSS's responsive utilities (`sm:hidden`, `sm:flex`) allows for precise control over element visibility based on screen size.
2.  **Design System Consistency**: The styling updates to `Navbar.tsx` and `ThemeToggle.tsx` aim to standardize the size, spacing, and overall appearance of interactive elements, contributing to a more cohesive and polished user interface across the SahiDawa platform.
3.  **Code Hygiene**: Removing unused imports in `apps/web/app/[locale]/page.tsx` is a standard practice to keep the codebase clean, reduce potential for confusion, and slightly optimize frontend bundle sizes.

We did not consider alternative authorization mechanisms for this specific fix, as the existing `requireRole` middleware was perfectly capable of addressing the issue with a minor configuration change.

## How To Re-Implement (Contributor Reference)

To re-implement or understand the flow of this change, a contributor would focus on two main areas: API authorization and frontend component styling/responsiveness.

**API Authorization (Backend - `apps/api/src/app.ts`):**

1.  **Identify the Main Application Entry Point**: Locate `apps/api/src/app.ts`, which is where our main Express application instance (`app`) is configured and where top-level middleware and routers are mounted.
2.  **Locate the Target Route**: Find the `app.use` statement responsible for mounting the admin routes. It will typically look like `app.use("/api/v1/admin", ..., adminRoutes);`.
3.  **Understand Middleware Chaining**: Note the order of middleware: `requireAuth` comes first to ensure a user is logged in, followed by `requireRole` for role-based access. The `adminRoutes` router is the final handler for the path.
4.  **Modify `requireRole` Parameters**: If a new role or an existing role needs access to these top-level admin APIs, modify the `requireRole` middleware call to include the necessary roles as arguments. For example, to allow "admin" and "moderator":

    ```typescript
    // Ensure requireAuth and requireRole are imported from their respective middleware files
    import { requireAuth } from "./middleware/auth.middleware"; // Example path
    import { requireRole } from "./middleware/role.middleware"; // Example path
    import adminRoutes from "./routes/admin.routes"; // Example path

    // ... other app configurations

    app.use("/api/v1/admin", requireAuth, requireRole("admin", "moderator"), adminRoutes);
    ```

    _Gotcha_: Ensure the roles passed to `requireRole` exactly match the role strings defined in our user management system.

5.  **Update Comments**: Always update any accompanying comments to accurately reflect the new authorization logic.

**Frontend Component Refinements (Frontend - `apps/web`):**

1.  **Responsive Navbar (`apps/web/app/[locale]/components/Navbar.tsx`):**
    - **Layout Structure**: Use `flex` containers extensively for flexible and responsive layouts. For instance, the main header container changed from `grid` to `flex` to allow for more dynamic content distribution.
    - **Spacing and Alignment**: Utilize Tailwind CSS spacing utilities (`gap-`, `px-`, `ml-auto`) and alignment utilities (`items-center`, `justify-end`) to control element positioning.
    - **Responsive Sizing**: Apply responsive classes like `sm:h-10 sm:w-10` for consistent element sizing across breakpoints.
    - **Conditional Visibility**: For elements that should appear differently or exclusively on certain screen sizes (e.g., mobile sign-in button), use `hidden`, `sm:hidden`, `sm:flex`, `lg:flex` to control their display.
    - **Text Truncation**: Use `truncate` class on text elements (like the `h1` for "SahiDawa") to prevent overflow on small screens.
    - **Icon Integration**: Integrate icons (e.g., `User` from `lucide-react`) for visual cues, especially for mobile-specific buttons where space is limited.

2.  **Consistent Theme Toggle (`apps/web/app/[locale]/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`):**
    - **Standardize Button Sizing**: Apply `flex h-9 w-9 items-center justify-center rounded-full sm:h-10 sm:w-10` to ensure the theme toggle button matches the size and shape of other interactive buttons in the `Navbar`.
    - **Mounted State**: Remember to use `useState(false)` and `useEffect` to ensure the component is mounted before rendering theme-dependent UI, preventing hydration mismatches.

3.  **Code Cleanup (`apps/web/app/[locale]/page.tsx`):**
    - **Remove Unused Imports**: Regularly review component files for unused `import` statements. Remove them to keep the code clean and reduce bundle size. Modern IDEs often highlight these automatically.

## Impact on System Architecture

This change has a significant positive impact on our system architecture, primarily in the area of **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** and **API Gateway Consistency**.

1.  **Enhanced RBAC Enforcement**: By correctly configuring the top-level admin API route, we have solidified our RBAC implementation. The "moderator" role is now fully functional within its intended scope, allowing these users to perform critical administrative tasks without encountering arbitrary `403` errors. This ensures that our API gateway correctly reflects the access policies defined for different user roles.
2.  **Improved API Gateway Consistency**: The fix eliminates a critical inconsistency between the frontend UI's perceived access and the backend API's actual enforcement. This brings the `apps/api/src/app.ts` route definition into alignment with the more granular route definitions in `apps/api/src/routes/admin.routes.ts` and the frontend's `apps/web/app/[locale]/admin/layout.tsx`. This consistency reduces potential confusion for developers and improves the predictability of our authorization system.
3.  **Unlocks Moderator Productivity**: From an operational standpoint, this change directly enables our moderator team to effectively manage reports, fetch medicine data, and update statuses, which are crucial for the SahiDawa platform's data integrity and user support.
4.  **Minor Frontend UX Improvements**: The frontend changes, while not directly related to the core API fix, contribute to a more robust and user-friendly web application. The improved mobile `Navbar` ensures better accessibility and discoverability of key actions, while the styling consistency contributes to a more polished overall user experience. The import cleanup is a minor but positive impact on code maintainability.

This PR reinforces the principle that authorization logic must be consistently applied across all layers of the application, from the UI to the API gateway and individual route handlers.

## Testing & Verification

The verification process for this change focused on ensuring that moderator users could successfully perform actions that were previously blocked, and that the overall system behavior remained correct for all user roles.

1.  **Moderator API Access Verification**:
    - A user with the "moderator" role was logged into the SahiDawa platform.
    - They navigated to the admin dashboard UI (`/admin`).
    - They attempted to perform key administrative actions that previously resulted in `403` errors:
        - Reviewing reports (e.g., fetching a list of reports).
        - Fetching medicine data.
        - Updating the status of a report.
    - Successful execution of these actions, without `403` errors, confirmed the fix. The PR description includes a screenshot as proof of successful access.

2.  **Consistency Check Across Layers**:
    - We verified that `apps/api/src/app.ts` (line 98) now uses `requireRole("admin", "moderator")`.
    - We confirmed that `apps/api/src/routes/admin.routes.ts` (line 13) already correctly used `requireRole('admin', 'moderator')`.
    - We confirmed that `apps/web/app/[locale]/admin/layout.tsx` (line 47) already correctly checks for both "admin" and "moderator" roles for UI access.
      This three-point check ensured that the authorization logic is consistent across the entire stack.

3.  **Regression Testing**:
    - Basic functionality for "admin" users was verified to ensure the change did not inadvertently restrict their access.
    - General user login and navigation were tested to ensure the frontend `Navbar` and `ThemeToggle` changes did not introduce regressions.

**Edge Cases**:

- **Unauthenticated Users**: Requests from unauthenticated users to `/api/v1/admin` would still be correctly blocked by the `requireAuth` middleware, resulting in a `401 Unauthorized` error, which is the expected behavior.
- **Users with Other Roles**: Users with roles other than "admin" or "moderator" (e.g., a standard "user" role) attempting to access `/api/v1/admin` would still be correctly blocked by the `requireRole("admin", "moderator")` middleware, resulting in a `403 Forbidden` error, which is also the expected behavior.
- **Frontend Responsiveness**: Manual testing across various browser sizes and device emulators was performed to ensure the `Navbar` and `ThemeToggle` components render correctly and maintain usability on mobile and desktop viewports.
