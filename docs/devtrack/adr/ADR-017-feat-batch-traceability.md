# ADR — Feat/batch traceability

> **Date:** 2026-05-31 | **PR:** #904 | **Status:** Accepted

## Context

Prior to this decision, SahiDawa lacked a mechanism for citizens to verify specific medicine batches, track their manufacturing and expiry details, identify the manufacturer, or report batch-specific issues. This limitation hindered transparency, citizen empowerment in verifying medicine authenticity, and the ability to respond to recalls or identify counterfeit products at a granular level. There was a clear need to provide detailed, batch-level traceability information to enhance trust and safety within the platform.

## Decision

A dedicated batch traceability system was implemented, comprising new database structures, API endpoints, and associated logic.

1.  **Database Schema:**
    - A new `manufacturers` table was created to store comprehensive details (name, license, address, contact, GMP certification, PostGIS location).
    - A new `batches` table was introduced, linking to `medicines` and `manufacturers` via foreign keys, and storing batch-specific data (batch number, manufacturing date, expiry date, recall status, recall reason).
    - The `medicines` table was updated with a `manufacturer_id` foreign key to link medicines directly to their primary manufacturer.
2.  **API Endpoints:**
    - A `GET /api/verify/batch/:batchNumber` endpoint was added to provide a comprehensive traceability response, including batch details, linked medicine information, manufacturer details, and a color-coded expiry status (green, yellow, red). This endpoint includes a fallback mechanism to the `medicines` table if no specific batch record exists.
    - A `POST /api/verify/batch/report` endpoint was created to allow citizens to submit batch-specific issues, which are recorded in the `counterfeit_reports` table.
3.  **Validation and Rate Limiting:**
    - Zod schemas were implemented for robust input validation on all batch-related API requests, specifically for batch numbers.
    - A `batchLimiter` was introduced, restricting batch lookup requests to 100 per hour per IP address to prevent abuse and ensure service stability.
4.  **API Integration:**
    - The new batch router was registered in `app.ts` at `/api/verify/batch`, ensuring it is processed before the general `/api/verify` route.
    - Swagger documentation was updated with component schemas for Batch and Manufacturer.
