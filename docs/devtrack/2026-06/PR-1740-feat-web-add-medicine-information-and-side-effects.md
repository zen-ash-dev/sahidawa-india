## What Changed

This pull request significantly enhances the user experience on our `ScanPage` by integrating a `MedicineSafetyPanel` to display crucial medicine information and side effects immediately after a successful scan. We also improved the responsiveness of the result modal by making it vertically scrollable and ensuring the close button remains accessible. Furthermore, we introduced a local development mock bypass in our API to facilitate easier frontend testing without requiring a full Supabase environment, and fixed a critical accessibility bug where the "View history" button was invisible in light mode.

## The Problem Being Solved

Previously, after a user scanned a medicine and received a CDSCO verified safe result, the system only displayed basic verification details. There was no immediate access to essential information like usage, dosage, precautions, or potential side effects, which is critical for informed medicine consumption. This meant users had to seek this information elsewhere, diminishing the utility of our platform as a comprehensive health resource. Additionally, on smaller screens, the detailed verification results could be clipped, making parts of the information inaccessible, and the "View history" button was visually broken in light mode due to hardcoded white text on a white background, impacting usability and accessibility. Finally, local development for the `ScanPage` required a running Supabase instance to simulate successful verification, which added unnecessary overhead for frontend-focused development and testing.

## Files Modified

- `apps/api/src/routes/verify.ts`
- `apps/web/app/[locale]/scan/page.tsx`

## Implementation Details

The core of this feature involved modifications across both our API and web application.

On the **web application (`apps/web/app/[locale]/scan/page.tsx`)**:

1.  **Medicine Safety Panel Integration**: We imported the `<MedicineSafetyPanel />` component from `@/components/medicine`. This component is now conditionally rendered within the `showResult` block, specifically after the `<VerificationResultCard />` and `<ShareButton />` components, but before the `<GenericAlternativeCard />` loading state. The `MedicineSafetyPanel` receives its `searchQuery` prop from the `verifyResult.medicine.brand_name` or `verifyResult.medicine.generic_name`, ensuring it displays relevant information for the scanned medicine. A `showSafetyPanel` state variable, initialized to `true`, controls its visibility, allowing for future expansion where users might toggle it. It also accepts an `onClose` callback to update this state.
2.  **Scrollable Result Modal Layout**: The main result overlay `div` (which previously had `absolute inset-0 z-30 flex items-center justify-center`) was updated. We changed its styling to `flex flex-col items-center justify-start overflow-y-auto bg-black/60 p-6 pt-20 pb-10 backdrop-blur-sm duration-300`. The key changes here are `flex-col` and `justify-start` to stack content vertically from the top, and `overflow-y-auto` to enable vertical scrolling when content exceeds the viewport height. The `pt-20 pb-10` padding ensures content is not obscured by the fixed header or footer.
3.  **Fixed Close Button**: The close button for the result modal was repositioned from `absolute top-4 right-4` to `fixed top-4 right-4`. This ensures the button remains visible and clickable even when the modal content scrolls, improving user experience on smaller screens. An `aria-label="Close"` was also added for improved accessibility.
4.  **"View history" Button Visibility Fix**: The `Link` component for "View history" at the bottom of the `ScanPage` had its Tailwind CSS classes updated. Hardcoded `border-white/15`, `bg-white/10`, and `text-white` were replaced with semantic theme variables: `border-(--color-border-muted)`, `bg-(--color-surface-muted)`, and `text-(--color-text-primary)`. This ensures the button's appearance correctly adapts to both light and dark modes as defined by our theme system.
5.  **State Reset**: The `showSafetyPanel` state is reset to `true` in both `handleDismissResult` and `handleResetScan` functions, ensuring the safety panel is visible by default upon a new scan result.

On the **API (`apps/api/src/routes/verify.ts`)**:

1.  **Local Development Mock Bypass**: Within the `router.post("/verify", ...)` handler, a new conditional block was introduced before the call to `lookupDrugByBatch`.
2.  We defined a `Set` named `ALLOWED_MOCK_BATCHES` containing specific strings like `"DOLO 650"`, `"DOLO-650"`, `"MOCK-DOLO-650"`, `"BN2024001"`, and `"AUG625D"`.
3.  The bypass logic activates if `process.env.VERIFY_ENABLE_MOCKS` is set to `"true"` and the `upperBatch` (the uppercase version of the `batchNumber` from the request) is present in `ALLOWED_MOCK_BATCHES`.
4.  If these conditions are met, a `mockMedicine` object is constructed with predefined values for `id`, `barcode_id`, `brand_name`, `generic_name`, `manufacturer`, `batch_number`, `expiry_date` (set to 2 years from now), `cdsco_approval_status` as `"approved"`, and `is_counterfeit_alert` as `false`. The `brand_name` and `generic_name` are dynamically set based on the `upperBatch` to provide more realistic mock data (e.g., "Dolo 650" for Dolo-related batches, "Augmentin 625" for "AUG625D").
5.  The API then responds with a `200` status and a JSON payload containing `verified: true`, the `mockMedicine` object, and a basic `scanMeta` object, effectively simulating a successful CDSCO verification without database interaction. A `return;` statement ensures the actual `lookupDrugByBatch` function is not called.

## Technical Decisions

1.  **Component-Based Approach for Safety Information**: We chose to integrate the medicine safety information via a dedicated `<MedicineSafetyPanel />` component. This aligns with our existing component-driven architecture, promoting reusability and separation of concerns. The panel is mounted directly within the `ScanPage`'s result overlay, ensuring immediate access to critical information without navigating away.
2.  **Tailwind CSS for Styling**: The styling adjustments for the scrollable modal and the "View history" button leverage Tailwind CSS utility classes. This decision is consistent with our frontend styling methodology, allowing for rapid and maintainable UI development. The use of semantic theme variables (`--color-border-muted`, etc.) for the button fix was crucial to ensure theme compatibility and avoid hardcoded values that break in different themes.
3.  **`overflow-y-auto` and `fixed` Positioning**: For the result modal, `overflow-y-auto` was chosen over `overflow-y-scroll` to only enable scrolling when necessary, providing a cleaner UI for shorter results. The `fixed` positioning for the close button was a deliberate choice to ensure it remains visible regardless of scroll position within the modal, which is a standard accessibility and usability pattern for overlays.
4.  **Environment Variable for Mocking**: The API's mock bypass is gated by `process.env.VERIFY_ENABLE_MOCKS === "true"`. This is a standard and secure practice for enabling development-specific features. It ensures that mock data is only served in controlled development environments and never in production, preventing accidental exposure of non-production data or logic. Using a `Set` for `ALLOWED_MOCK_BATCHES` provides efficient lookup for batch numbers.

## How To Re-Implement (Contributor Reference)

To re-implement this feature or understand its exact flow, a contributor would follow these steps:

1.  **Frontend - Integrating the Safety Panel and UI Enhancements:**
    - **Locate `ScanPage`**: Navigate to `apps/web/app/[locale]/scan/page.tsx`.
    - **Import `MedicineSafetyPanel`**: Add `import { MedicineSafetyPanel } from "@/components/medicine";` at the top of the file.
    - **Add State for Panel Visibility**: Declare a new state variable: `const [showSafetyPanel, setShowSafetyPanel] = useState(true);`
    - **Update Reset Functions**: In `handleDismissResult` and `handleResetScan`, ensure `setShowSafetyPanel(true)` is called to reset the panel's visibility for subsequent scans.
    - **Modify Result Overlay Layout**: Find the `div` element with `className="animate-in fade-in zoom-in absolute inset-0 z-30 flex items-center justify-center bg-black/60 p-6 backdrop-blur-sm duration-300"`. Change its `className` to `animate-in fade-in zoom-in absolute inset-0 z-30 flex flex-col items-center justify-start overflow-y-auto bg-black/60 p-6 pt-20 pb-10 backdrop-blur-sm duration-300`. This enables vertical scrolling and adjusts padding.
    - **Reposition Close Button**: Locate the `button` element for closing the result modal (containing `<X size={24} />`). Change its `className` from `absolute top-4 right-4` to `fixed top-4 right-4`. Add the `aria-label="Close"` attribute for accessibility.
    - **Render `MedicineSafetyPanel`**: Within the `verifyResult.verified` block, after the `<ShareButton />` component, add the conditional rendering for the safety panel:
        ```jsx
        {
            showSafetyPanel && verifyResult.medicine && (
                <MedicineSafetyPanel
                    searchQuery={
                        verifyResult.medicine.brand_name || verifyResult.medicine.generic_name || ""
                    }
                    onClose={() => setShowSafetyPanel(false)}
                />
            );
        }
        ```
        Note the additional `verifyResult.medicine` check for robustness.
    - **Fix "View history" Button Styling**: Find the `Link` component with `href="/history"`. Update its `className` to use semantic theme variables:
        ```html
        <Link
            href="/history"
            className="inline-flex items-center justify-center gap-2 rounded-full border border-(--color-border-muted) bg-(--color-surface-muted) px-4 py-2 text-sm font-bold text-(--color-text-primary) shadow-sm transition-colors hover:bg-(--color-border-muted) focus:ring-2 focus:ring-emerald-500 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-black focus:outline-none dark:border-white/20 dark:bg-white/10 dark:text-white dark:hover:bg-white/20"
        >
            <History size={18} />
            View history
        </Link>
        ```

2.  **Backend - Implementing Local Mock Verification:**
    - **Locate `verify.ts`**: Navigate to `apps/api/src/routes/verify.ts`.
    - **Identify Verification Endpoint**: Find the `router.post("/verify", ...)` handler.
    - **Add Mock Bypass Logic**: Insert the following code block _before_ the `try { const data = await lookupDrugByBatch(batchNumber); ... }` block:

        ```typescript
        const upperBatch = batchNumber.toUpperCase();
        const ALLOWED_MOCK_BATCHES = new Set([
            "DOLO 650",
            "DOLO-650",
            "MOCK-DOLO-650",
            "BN2024001",
            "AUG625D",
        ]);

        if (process.env.VERIFY_ENABLE_MOCKS === "true" && ALLOWED_MOCK_BATCHES.has(upperBatch)) {
            const brandName = upperBatch.includes("DOLO")
                ? "Dolo 650"
                : upperBatch === "AUG625D"
                  ? "Augmentin 625"
                  : "Mock Medicine";
            const genericName = upperBatch.includes("DOLO")
                ? "Paracetamol"
                : upperBatch === "AUG625D"
                  ? "Amoxicillin + Clavulanic Acid"
                  : "Mock Generic";

            const mockMedicine = {
                id: "mock-id-dolo",
                barcode_id: "8901148220042",
                brand_name: brandName,
                generic_name: genericName,
                manufacturer: "Micro Labs Ltd",
                batch_number: upperBatch,
                expiry_date: new Date(Date.now() + 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 * 2).toISOString(), // 2 years expiry
                cdsco_approval_status: "approved",
                is_counterfeit_alert: false,
            };
            res.status(200).json({
                verified: true,
                medicine: mockMedicine,
                scanMeta: {
                    recentScanCount24h: 1,
                    recentScanCount7d: 1,
                    suspicious: false,
                    suspicionReasons: [],
                },
            });
            return; // Crucial to prevent further execution
        }
        ```

    - **Environment Variable Setup**: To enable this mock behavior in a local development environment, set `VERIFY_ENABLE_MOCKS=true` in your `.env.local` file for the API service.

## Impact on System Architecture

This change primarily impacts the user-facing `ScanPage` by significantly enriching the information presented to the user post-verification, transforming it from a mere verification tool into a comprehensive medicine information hub. The integration of `MedicineSafetyPanel` establishes a pattern for embedding rich, context-aware data directly into user workflows, which can be extended to other parts of the platform.

The addition of the local mock bypass in the API is a crucial developer experience improvement. It decouples frontend development on the `ScanPage` from the need for a fully operational backend database (like Supabase) for basic verification scenarios. This reduces local setup complexity, speeds up iteration cycles for UI/UX changes, and makes it easier for new contributors to get started on frontend tasks without deep backend dependencies. This pattern could be replicated for other API endpoints where frontend-only testing is beneficial.

The UI/UX improvements, particularly the scrollable modal and fixed close button, enhance the platform's accessibility and usability across diverse devices, aligning with our commitment to a robust and inclusive health platform. The "View history" button fix reinforces our adherence to semantic theming and accessibility best practices.

## Testing & Verification

This change was verified through a combination of manual testing and visual inspection.

1.  **Frontend Verification**:
    - **Medicine Safety Panel**: We manually scanned various mock batch numbers (e.g., "DOLO 650", "AUG625D") on the `ScanPage` in a local development environment with `VERIFY_ENABLE_MOCKS=true`. We confirmed that the `<MedicineSafetyPanel />` appeared correctly within the result overlay and displayed relevant information based on the `brand_name` or `generic_name` provided by the mock API response.
    - **Scrollable Modal**: We tested the `ScanPage` on various screen sizes and simulated long content within the result modal to ensure `overflow-y-auto` correctly enabled vertical scrolling.
    - **Fixed Close Button**: We verified that the close button remained `fixed` at the top-right corner and was always visible and clickable, even when the modal content was scrolled. The `aria-label="Close"` was confirmed via browser accessibility tools.
    - **"View history" Button**: We switched between light and dark modes to ensure the "View history" button's text and border were consistently visible and correctly themed, resolving the prior visibility bug.

2.  **Backend Mock Verification**:
    - We started the API locally with `VERIFY_ENABLE_MOCKS=true` in the environment variables.
    - We sent POST requests to `/api/verify` with `batchNumber` values like "DOLO 650", "BN2024001", and "AUG625D".
    - We confirmed that the API returned a `200` status code with the expected `verified: true` payload containing the `mockMedicine` object, bypassing the actual `lookupDrugByBatch` function.
    - We also tested with a batch number not in `ALLOWED_MOCK_BATCHES` to ensure the mock bypass did not activate, and the request proceeded to the actual `lookupDrugByBatch` logic.

**Edge Cases**:

- **No `verifyResult.medicine`**: The `MedicineSafetyPanel` is conditionally rendered only if `verifyResult.medicine` exists, preventing errors if the API response is malformed or incomplete.
- **Empty `searchQuery`**: The `searchQuery` for `MedicineSafetyPanel` defaults to an empty string if both `brand_name` and `generic_name` are missing, gracefully handling cases where medicine names might not be available.
- **`VERIFY_ENABLE_MOCKS` not set**: If `VERIFY_ENABLE_MOCKS` is not explicitly set to `"true"`, the mock bypass will not activate, ensuring production environments are unaffected.
