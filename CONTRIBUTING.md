## Development Setup

### Requirements

| Tool    | Version    | Install                            |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Node.js | >= 18.0.0  | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)   |

| Supabase CLI | Latest | [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started) |

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` (frontend) and `.env` (API). You need:

```bash
# Supabase — free at supabase.com (no credit card)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key

# Cloudinary — free at cloudinary.com
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Redis — free at upstash.com (no credit card)
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_redis_url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_token
```

> **For i18n contributors (translations):** You do NOT need any environment variables. Just edit the JSON file and run `npm run dev`.

### Running with Docker (Recommended)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your keys, then:
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

### Running manually

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Local Database (Supabase)
# Ensure Docker is running in the background first
npx supabase start

# Terminal 2 — Frontend
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000

# Terminal 2 — API
cd apps/api
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:4000

# Terminal 3 — ML Service (optional for Phase 1/2 work)
cd apps/ml
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting npm install Failures

If you encounter `No matching version found` errors while running `npm install`, it may be caused by the canary package versions currently used in this project.

Try running:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

or:

```bash
npm install --force
```

If the issue still persists, you may temporarily downgrade package versions locally to get the project running on your machine.

> ⚠️ Important:
> Do not commit modified `package.json` or `package-lock.json` files created during local downgrades. Revert those changes before pushing your PR.

## Contribution Types

### 🟢 Beginner — Great for first-time open source contributors

#### Translation (i18n)

Each Indian language has a dedicated issue. Pick one unclaimed language.

1. Open `apps/web/messages/en.json`
2. Copy the entire file
3. Create `apps/web/messages/[language-code].json`
4. Translate every value (keep the keys in English — only translate values)
5. Do NOT translate: URLs, component names, variable placeholders like `{count}`

Example:

```json
// en.json
{ "scan.button": "Scan Medicine", "scan.result.real": "This medicine is REAL" }

// ta.json (Tamil)
{ "scan.button": "மருந்தை ஸ்கேன் செய்யுங்கள்", "scan.result.real": "இந்த மருந்து உண்மையானது" }
```

#### UI Components

- Pick a component issue labeled `good-first-issue` + `frontend`
- All components go in `apps/web/components/`
- Use shadcn/ui primitives wherever possible
- Must be accessible (keyboard navigable, proper ARIA labels)

#### Documentation

- Fix typos, improve explanations, add usage examples
- All docs are Markdown files in `docs/`

#### Database Seeds

- Add medicine entries to `data/seeds/medicines.csv`
- Format: `batch_number,brand_name,generic_name,manufacturer,strength,form`
- Source only from [official CDSCO drug database](https://cdsco.gov.in/opencms/opencms/en/consumer/Know-your-medicine/)

---

### 🟡 Intermediate

#### Barcode Scanner Integration

- Uses `@zxing/browser` library
- Component: `apps/web/components/scanner/`
- Must work on mobile Chrome and Safari
- Needs to handle: Code128, QR Code, EAN-13, EAN-8 formats

#### Pharmacy Map

- Uses Leaflet.js + OpenStreetMap
- Backend: PostGIS `ST_DWithin` query to find pharmacies within radius
- Component: `apps/web/components/map/`
- Must work offline (tiles cached by Workbox)

#### Cloudinary Integration

- Photo upload component for reporting suspicious medicines
- Use Cloudinary's upload widget or direct API
- Store: `cloud_name/sahidawa/reports/{medicine_batch}_{timestamp}`
- See [Cloudinary docs](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_widget)

#### API Routes

- All routes in `apps/api/src/routes/`
- Use TypeScript — no `any` types
- Every route needs: input validation (Zod), error handling, rate limiting
- Write tests in `apps/api/tests/`

---

### 🔴 Advanced

#### Medicine Image Classifier (TF Lite)

- Training data: Cloudinary photo submissions
- Task: Binary classification — real packaging vs suspicious/fake
- Target: TF Lite model running on-device (< 5MB)
- See `apps/ml/models/` for model structure

#### Whisper Voice Integration

- Self-hosted Whisper endpoint in FastAPI (`apps/ml/routers/voice.py`)
- Accept audio blob from browser MediaRecorder API
- Return transcript + detected language
- Handle all 22 Indian scheduled languages

#### LangChain RAG Health Assistant

- Knowledge base: NHP drug monographs + CDSCO guidelines (chunked + embedded)
- Vector store: pgvector in Supabase
- LLM: Sarvam AI (Indian language aware)
- Output: Triage recommendation + nearest doctor/pharmacy
- See `apps/ml/services/rag/`

#### CDSCO Alert Monitoring Agent

- LangChain agent that polls CDSCO every 6 hours
- Tools: `fetch_cdsco_alerts`, `lookup_medicine_db`, `send_district_notification`
- Runs as a cron job in `apps/ml/agent/`
- This is the GSSoC **Agents for India Track** flagship feature

---

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript / JavaScript

```typescript
// ✅ Good — typed, descriptive, handles errors
async function verifyMedicine(
  batchNumber: string,
): Promise<VerificationResult> {
  if (!batchNumber || batchNumber.length < 4) {
    throw new ValidationError("Invalid batch number");
  }
  // ...
}

// ❌ Bad — untyped, vague name, no error handling
async function check(b: any) {
  // ...
}
```

- Use TypeScript everywhere — no `any` types
- Use `async/await` over `.then()` chains
- All functions must have JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use `zod` for all API input validation
- Prefer `const` over `let`, never use `var`

### Python (ML Service)

```python
# ✅ Good — typed hints, docstring, handles exceptions
def decode_barcode(image_bytes: bytes) -> BarcodeResult | None:
    """
    Decode a barcode or QR code from raw image bytes.

    Args:
        image_bytes: Raw image data as bytes

    Returns:
        BarcodeResult with format and value, or None if no barcode found
    """
    try:
        # ...
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Barcode decode failed: {e}")
        return None
```

- Use Python type hints everywhere
- Write docstrings for all public functions
- Use `pydantic` for request/response models in FastAPI
- All ML models must have evaluation metrics documented

### CSS / Tailwind

- Use Tailwind utility classes only — no custom CSS unless unavoidable
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Test on 320px wide viewport (minimum)
- All interactive elements must have focus states
